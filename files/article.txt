California is among the world's largest economies, but the engines that drive it haven't been firing on all cylinders.

The state has been buffeted by a litany of layoffs this year from Hollywood to Silicon Valley — and beyond. Economists cite several explanations, including contraction in the entertainment industry, displacements caused by artificial intelligence and overall uncertainty in the national economy.

This year, thousands of workers at Amazon, Intel, Salesforce, Meta, Paramount, Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Co. have lost their jobs. Even Apple just announced a rare round of cuts.

Seemingly no corner of entertainment and tech has been immune from the cost-cutting that has put workers on edge.

"People are hunkering down because they think a storm is coming," UC Berkeley labor economist Jesse Rothstein said.

Through October there were 158,734 layoffs announced in California, compared with 136,661 for the same period last year. That was the most of any state, lagging behind only Washington, D.C., which has been hit hard by federal downsizing, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.

Nationwide, the layoffs have topped 1 million so far for the year, the most since the pandemic, according to Challenger.

As in the late 1990s, there's a disruptive technology at play again — artificial intelligence, which is fueling a Silicon Valley investment boom reminiscent of the build-up to the last tech bust.

AI has been cited in more than 48,000 of the U.S. job cuts this year, with about 31,000 of those taking place in October alone, Challenger said.

"AI is replacing some of the entry level jobs in tech. And yes, AI is actually replacing some jobs in Hollywood," said economist Chris Thornberg, founding partner at Beacon Economics in Los Angeles.
Key announcements included a mooted extension of the freeze on income tax thresholds until the 2030/31 financial year, which is expected to raise £7.6bn by 2029/30.

Reeves also confirmed that salary-sacrificed pension contributions above £2,000 per year would be liable for national insurance (NI), which is estimated would raise £4.7bn in 2029/30.

In addition, the chancellor confirmed that a "high value" council tax surcharge would be applied on properties worth over £2m, which is expected to raise an estimated £400m in 2029/30.

As a result of these budget announcements, Reeves said that she would more than double her fiscal headroom to £21.7bn, from a previous £9.9bn.
Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: "Today’s budget was better than expected on many fronts – while perhaps under-delivering on other parts.

"The good news from a market perspective will be the more than doubling of the chancellor’s fiscal headroom. Cost of living measures will also deliver a modest but meaningful dampening of inflation (0.4 percentage points) – largely as expected, making the Bank of England’s job a little easier next year."

In addition, he said that borrowing "remains broadly on track" to drop below 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of the decade.
"And the government’s central government net cash requirement looks slightly lower than we projected over the next four fiscal years," he added.

However, Raja pointed out that many of the "consolidation efforts are backloaded – raising questions around both the credibility of such fiscal tightening and whether they will be implemented ahead of the next general election."

Matt Tickle, chief investment officer at Barnett Waddingham, said that despite an immediate dip in the FTSE the market reaction to the leaked OBR report was "pretty subdued".

"Some front loading of welfare spending and longer-term tax rises might generate headlines for a few weeks, but none of the fiscal changes look substantial enough to impact the gilt or sterling markets," he added.
The United States Home Healthcare Market is projected to grow significantly, from US$ 115.13 billion in 2024 to US$ 210.25 billion by 2033, driven by a 6.92% CAGR. This surge is fueled by an aging population, rising chronic diseases, and a preference for in-home care, enhancing patient comfort and convenience. Key growth factors include cost-effectiveness over institutional care, technological advances in remote services, and increasing insurance coverage. Major challenges involve workforce shortages, complex regulations, and reimbursement issues. Top states like California, New York, and Washington drive market demand through advanced healthcare infrastructure.
The United States Home Healthcare Market is expected to see substantial growth, rising from US$ 115.13 Billion in 2024 to US$ 210.25 Billion in 2033. This growth reflects a strong Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 6.92% from 2025 to 2033.

The drivers of this growth are an aging population, a higher incidence of chronic diseases, and a preference for in-home care services, which promote patient comfort and convenience.
Home healthcare has gained immense popularity in recent years in the United States for a number of reasons. The boom generation that is aging is now looking for alternatives to hospitalization and wants the convenience of recovery and management of chronic diseases in the comfort of home. Further, technology has allowed medical professionals to provide effective and efficient care from a distance, making the service more accessible.

Insurance providers have also come to appreciate the worth of home healthcare, tending to cover a wider array of services, further increasing its popularity. Therefore, home healthcare is becoming an essential part of the American healthcare system, providing affordable solutions prioritizing patient convenience and health.

Growth Drivers in the United States Home Healthcare Market

Aging Population and Increasing Chronic Diseases

The United States has a rapidly growing population of the elderly, with millions of people aged above 65 needing constant medical care. This age pattern is among the most powerful forces behind the home healthcare market. Older people tend to have chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, and respiratory ailments, which need long-term treatment and observation.
Home healthcare is a cost-effective, comfortable, and personalized option compared to hospitalization or long-term care institutions. The number of Americans aged 65 and older will grow from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million in 2050 (a 47% increase), and the 65-and-older segment's proportion of the entire population is expected to increase from 17% to 23%.

Cost-Effectiveness Compared to Institutional Care

The increasing hospital and nursing facility costs are driving patients and healthcare systems alike to look toward home healthcare as a viable option. Home healthcare services, including skilled nursing, physio, wound care, and chronic disease management, can be provided at a fifth of the price of inpatient care.

This is especially significant in the U.S., where healthcare costs are among the highest in the world. Home healthcare usage is promoted by insurance companies and government programs more and more to eliminate the cost burden on the healthcare system. For patients, home-based care eliminates costs of prolonged hospitalization, transportation, and ancillary services.

Technological Advances in Remote Care

Advancements in healthcare technology have revolutionized the business of home healthcare in the United States. The convergence of telehealth platforms, wearable monitoring devices, mobile applications, and artificial intelligence-enabled diagnostic solutions enables healthcare professionals to provide quality care remotely. Patients with conditions such as heart failure, diabetes, or COPD can now be continuously monitored in real time without multiple hospital visits. All this enhances drug compliance, increases patient safety, and prevents hospital readmissions.

Technology also facilitates caregivers to identify early warning signs and act in a timely manner, enhancing patient outcomes. U.S. Food and Drug Administration is issuing the launch of a new initiative, Home as a Health Care Hub, to assist in reimagining the home setting as a central part of the health care system, with the aim of driving forward health and wellness for everyone in the U.S. Although most care options are presently trying to utilize the home as a virtual clinical location, few have contemplated the structural and critical aspects of the home that will be needed to accommodate this transference of care.

Challenges in the United States Home Healthcare Market

Workforce Shortages and Training Gaps

One of the biggest challenges the U.S. home healthcare market confronts is the lack of capable health-care practitioners. With demand increasing fast for home care, great pressure is placed on the workforce, such as nurses, therapists, and home health aides. Numerous professionals are being overloaded, and as a result, burnout and high turnover occur.

Also, training deficits are present, especially in managing sophisticated technologies and multiple complex chronic conditions in the home environment. The absence of standardized training and certification programs makes service quality even more difficult. For patients, this workforce stress can lead to variable delivery of care and extended wait times for services. The solution to this entails investment in workforce development, improved wages, and career advancement opportunities to recruit and retain the best talent.

Regulatory and Reimbursement Complexities

The U.S. home healthcare market is confronted by complicated regulatory environments and reimbursement issues that interfere with seamless market expansion. Home care services are regulated by strict state and federal regulations, making differences in compliance needs across states. Administrative tasks of licensing, quality reporting, and documentation frequently burden providers.

Reimbursement concerns bring an added layer of complexity, as Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance coverage differ markedly. Certain vital services and sophisticated technologies are poorly reimbursed, making them unaffordable and inaccessible for patients. Smaller providers especially face financial unsustainability under such circumstances. Reimbursement delays also impact cash flow, which poses operational challenges.
